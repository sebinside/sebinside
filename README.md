Hi, I am [Sebastian](https://sebastianhahner.de) ðŸ‘‹.
I am [doctoral researcher at KIT, Karlsruhe](https://dsis.kastel.kit.edu/staff_sebastian_hahner.php) since 2020 and [web-video creator](https://skate702.de/) for more than a decade.
For many years now, I develop open-source software. Much of this development is also streamed [live on twitch](https://skate702.tv).
My personal projects are centered around Minecraft modding and streaming utilities.
I am also co-founder of [Code Overflow](https://codeoverflow.org) that develops the streaming utility [nodecg-io](https://nodecg.io).

#### Current projects (âœ… = Under development, ðŸŸ¡ = Maintainted)
âœ… [nodecg-io](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/nodecg-io), a NodeCG-bundle that enables the easy integration of social media APIs into stream automation

âœ… [skates-bundles](https://github.com/sebinside/skates-bundles), a collection of my own NodeCG-bundles that I use in my twitch livestream

**FAQ**: I usually develop in Java, Scala, and TypeScript using Visual Studio Code (monokai-themed) or IntelliJ IDEA ([custom](https://skate702.de/extra/rainbow.jar)-themed).
