Hi, I am [Sebastian](https://sebastianhahner.de) ðŸ‘‹.
I am [doctoral researcher at KIT, Karlsruhe](https://dsis.kastel.kit.edu/staff_sebastian_hahner.php) since 2020 and [web-video creator](https://skate702.de/) for more than a decade.
For many years now, I develop open-source software. Much of this development is also streamed [live on twitch](https://skate702.tv).
My personal projects are centered around minecraft modding and streaming utilities.
I am also co-founder of [Code Overflow](https://codeoverflow.org) that develops the streaming utility [nodecg-io](https://nodecg.io).
