Hi, I am [Sebastian](https://sebastianhahner.de) 👋.
I am [doctoral researcher at KIT, Karlsruhe](https://dsis.kastel.kit.edu/staff_sebastian_hahner.php) since 2020 and [web-video creator](https://skate702.de/) for more than a decade.
For many years now, I develop open-source software. Much of this development is also streamed [live on twitch](https://702.yt/live).
On GitHub, you can find personal projects, live-developed streaming utilities and tools, and also all software we develop at the university.
I usually develop in Java, Scala, and TypeScript using Visual Studio Code (monokai-themed) or IntelliJ IDEA ([custom](https://skate702.de/extra/rainbow.jar)-themed).

#### Research Projects

⚙️ [JPlag](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag) is the leading open-source code plagiarism finder, used in universities all over the world, and originally created in Java 1.0 (!). I co-lead the development and maintenance since 2020.

🔒 [Palladio Data Flow Analysis](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-Addons-DataFlowConfidentiality-Analysis) is a data flow-based confidentiality analysis using the Palladio software architecture modeling. I'm heading the development since 2022, the analysis has originally be designed by [Stephan Seifermann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=ViNvFxwAAAAJ).

❓ [ABUNAI](https://github.com/abunai-dev) extends architecture-based data flow analysis to measure the impact of uncertainty in a software system and its environment on confidentiality. This research approach is developed for my dissertation.

#### Personal Projects

🎞️ [PremiereRemote](https://github.com/sebinside/PremiereRemote) provides customizable remote access to Adobe Premiere Pro CEP.

🔨 [HotkeylessAHK](https://github.com/sebinside/HotkeylessAHK) enables the execution of AutoHotkey code by sending HTTP requests, e.g., using the companion Stream Deck plugin.

📱 [StreamAwesome](https://github.com/sebinside/StreamAwesome) generates Stream Deck Icons using Font Awesome, available [online](https://skate702.de/StreamAwesome) for free!

✏️ [WissenschaftlichesSchreiben-Schnelleinstieg](https://github.com/sebinside/WissenschaftlichesSchreiben-Schnelleinstieg) is a German quick start guide to scientific writing that I use in teaching at the university.
